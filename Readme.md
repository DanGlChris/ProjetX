In 2018, I lived in the Democratic Republic of Congo. I started to code all the time and I felt a need to organise myself.
I needed some software that should help me to remember each actions that I do or I have to do by using a graphic.
I was inspired by one application that i used call XMind https://www.xmind.net/

## Version
The frist version was created in neatbeans but I recreated it in <strong>Intellij Idea</strong> with Java 9 and JavaFX 

> On this project I tried to apply what I learn form this book <a href ="https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484230411">Pro JavaFX 9</a> and <a href ="https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/product/Liang-Intro-to-Java-Programming-Comprehensive-Version-10th-Edition/9780133761313.html">Intro to Java Programming, Comprehensive Version, 10th Edition</a> 
> I used many concepts such:
    <ul>
      <li>JavaFX Node and Shapes (Rectangle, Line, Circle)</li>
      <li>Collection (List, ArrayList)</li>
      <li>Inheritance and Polymorphism</li>
      <li>Abstract class and Polymorphism</li>
    </ul>
